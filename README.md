# natours-travel-website-project

A fully responsive fictional travel website fully loaded with advance CSS3 animations.  

I also learned the CSS architecture: The 7-1 rule, component-based design, the BEM methodology, writing reusable, maintainable and scalable code. How to architect and build a simple grid system with floats. This project uses float layout.
